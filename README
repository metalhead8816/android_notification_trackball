Changelog:

v0.1:
	- Initial commit of version with notification succession
	- Uses a thread that constantly sleeps to update the colors based on
	  an ArrayList of NotificationRecords

v0.2:
	- Updated to not include notifications of the same color multiple
	  times

v0.3:
	- Hopefully a fix for the issue of the notifications not staying awake.
	- More debugging output so people can get me some logs. 

v0.4:
	- Fixed to use the eclair branch code instead of donut
	- Options for flashing while screen on, at all work now (eclair options)
	- Fixed the sleeping issue. Should now work with the screen off.

TODOs:
	- Optimize battery for the case where there is only one notification
	  as there is no need to switch back and forth.
